# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any security vulnerability can be reported at the project [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/WELD).
When creating the issue, there is a special tick box to mark the issue as security sensitive so make sure to select it: 
- [x] `This issue is security relevant`
